## Dependencies
* numpy is needed to run this program

## Functional requirements individual breakdown
* Noah King = Logic, Repository setup, bug fixing
* JD Otis = GUI, Test Automation, logic, unittests
* Tyler Robertson = GUI functionality
* JP Rogers = Logic Unittests, bug fixing
* Chris Silhavy = ReadME, GUI, presentation

## Instructions
* After loading file into your local drive, input in the terminal ".venv\scripts\activate" to start your virtual space
* Once the virtual space is loaded, enter in the terminal "python -m main" to run the program and open the Calculator
* After Calculator is open, click the button for the input you want followed by the function you want to compute followed by the second number and hit the equals sign
* Note: the number will disappear after you hit the input of the function
* To run the next function you must clear the calculator or it will work off the previous answer as the first input (e.g., 1 + 1 = 2, the next input will continue off of 2)
